## I BUILD WEBSITES FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY CARE

I run **YESHAYA.DEV**, a marketing and web development agency focused exclusively on  
**nonprofits, advocacy groups, and mission-driven organizations**.

The goal is simple:  
**clear messaging, strong trust, and sites that convert support into real action.**

No bloated templates.  
No VC-bro SaaS nonsense.  
Just fast, accessible, well-designed websites that help people do good work better.

## WHAT I DO

- Custom websites for nonprofits & mission-driven orgs  
- Clear information architecture and storytelling  
- High-converting donation, signup, and campaign flows  
- SEO that helps people actually find your cause  
- Clean, maintainable code (no black-box page builders)

## PHILOSOPHY

I don’t believe software is neutral.  
I choose who I build for.

If a project helps people, strengthens communities, or makes the world more livable,
I’m interested.

If it’s just about squeezing more profit out of people, I’m not.
